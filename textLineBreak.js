console.log('Text line break is running sound!');

// First, create a function that uses indexOf() method to figure out at which point in the text are the breaking points

// Using the returned value from the previous function, define another function that will remove all the -break(s) from the text

// After finishing off with the above function, create a last one to handle the breaking points and apply the feature, based on the first function's values

// All this project must be done using OOP concept
